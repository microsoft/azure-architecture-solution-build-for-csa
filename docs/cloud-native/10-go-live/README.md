## Are they ready to go live?

Key question to ask before the partner takes the final plunge and fully commits to go live, include:

* Is there a Microsoft support contract in place that meets their needs, and equally importantly, do the key stakeholders know how to raise a ticket?
    * If something goes wrong and there is no one to help it can destroy customers trust in the partner and create frustration with Microsoft 
    * Ensure the team know what the support contract covers and how to raise and track an issue
    * [Azure Support Plans Comparison](https://azure.microsoft.com/support/plans/)
* Have they run a beta programme or worked closely with early adopters to ensure the system works well
    * Always get feedback, always test, always go through a beta process to validate both the application and its deployment
* Has everything been tested?
    * Have they done full code coverage tests? 
    * A project going live late is always better, and less time consuming, than a project going live untested
* Is there a disaster recovery plan in place and does the partner understand the various SLAs and recovery options?
    * And when was the disaster recovery plan last tested? 
* Is there a failback plan in place in case anything goes wrong and they need to back out of the deployment?
    * If they have a DevOps mindset and deployment pipeline in place, this should be a lot easier 
    * What is the expected data loss (if any)
* Is all the monitoring and telemetry in place to give them confidence that the system is healthy and detect issues before they impact customers?
    * Dashboards, email and SMS alerts, etc are all essential parts of the monitoring process 
* What is the next stage of development?
    * It is easy to lose momentum at go live but the bigger picture should always be considered and next steps now they have reached a level of maturity should be discussed. Such as components that will increase their competitive advantage which might include additional Azure services and tools such as AI or new reporting
