## Introduction

This living document represents a set of key questions and guidance to help Architects at all career stages when first engaging with a partner to deliver excellence in their activities. This will help repeat the success we found with partners and accelerate new engagements. 

With such a large Azure eco system and diverse range of products it is sometimes hard to know what the decision points are and the questions that should be asked to get to the core of the architecture. This document will enable others to take the condensed expertise of many experienced architects and apply this to new engagements and activities.

## Purpose

This document is designed to provide a set of key questions that need to be raised, discussed and
resolved during the design, development and deployment stages of any major Azure system. It is a
personal list based on the experience of the authors and represent some of the common questions,
challenges, and areas of discussion and research for systems design and developers, that come up
again and again across a whole range of different solutions. The hope is that this document will
prove useful to people who are **newer to the architectural role or the Azure platform**, and help give
them a great basis for learning, expanding their skills, leading to high quality discussions and better solutions.

There are no right or wrong answers to these questions, but based on many years experience
working with Azure, asking these questions and listening to the responses, and potentially
challenging those response, and drilling down into them, is a really healthy exercise that will
promote open discussion and improve the overall quality of any architecture and design that comes
out this process.

Links to public articles are provided in the hope that both the reader and the partner will find them
interesting, informative and educational, but we don't drill down in this document into any specific
technology in any depth in this guide, as our Microsoft technology stack will evolve overtime and we
want to keep this discussion at a relatively high level. This document doesn't push anyone particular
design, but is rather designed to unearth what is key, or critical or different about a particular
partners needs, requirements, skill set, timelines etc. But it is all based on real world experiences.
